# Tuesday 09/27 Week 1
Why is cognition important?
- Basic part of what it is to be human
- Constantly using cognitive systems, awake or asleep
- Memory and attention loss (aging, alzheimer’s, brain insult)

A Mix of:
- Experimental psychology
- Comp sci
- Philosophy
- Linguistics
- Neuroscience

Right tools for asking the right questions in a way to get an answer
- How does memory work? Why do you forget something?
- What is attention? Is attention one thing or lots of other things?
- Computers get right answer on some things, while humans always get the wrong answers

# Thursday 09/29 Week 1
Early history
- A lot of psychology was influenced by psychology
- Aristotle began writing about the associations in memory
- British build on this idea, and they started linking associations in memory
- Brain picks up on associations to make sense of what is happening

German Physicists
- Helmholtz: Trichromatic theory of color vision
- Fechner: Psychophysics
- Contribution to cognitive psychology
	- Use of scientific/experimental methods
- Limitation
	- Limited to study of simple mental processes (which weight is heavier)

The Problem
- Traditionally 3 things we can observe
	- Ourselves
	- Stimulus response relationships
	- Physiology
	- Stimuli -> response

Solutions to problem
- Introspection
	- Look inwards to figure it out
	- Difficult to verify, (colorblind)
	- Subjective, private not public
	- End product, not the process
- Behaviorism
	- Stimulus response relationships
	- If you cant see something, don’t talk about it
	- Only focuses on stimulus response relationships
	- Dog bell steak
- Cognitivism
	- Can’t directly observe mental processes
	- Infer what is happening inside the mind
	- Try and figure out what is happening, tight experiments
- Neuroscience
	- Brain activity

Instrumental/Operational conditioning
- If something is desirable, the relationship is strengthened 

Behaviorism
- Psychology as science of behavior

Problems with behaviorist approach
- Can’t account for diversity of human behavior
	- Language, navigation
- Perhaps limitation to observable isn’t necessarily scientific
	- Electrons, Genes
- Behaviorism was complete flop for applied issues during WWII
	- Staring at radar, false alarms

What is cognitive psychology?
- The scientific study of mental processes
- Includes: 
	- Perception, attention, memory, language, reasoning, problem solving, division making
- Underlying assumption
	- Cognition is like a computer program
	- Cognitive psychologists need to figure out the program
	- Intelligent behavior is decomposable into parts
	- Each part easier to understand than the whole
	- Figure out each little component then build it back up to understand
	- All elements fit together

Information processing stages
- Stimulus -> processing -> more processing -> response
- Each stage
	- Receives information from the previous stage, transfers it, and send info to the next stage

Stages of memory
- Encoding -> storage -> Retrieval
- Studying for an exam to remember things
- Retrieve information on exam day

Two questions
- What are the stages in a task?
- How long does each stage last?

Subtraction method
- Simple RT
	- Detection -> response -> simple RT
- Choice RT
	- Detection -> discrim -> selection -> response -> choice RT
- go/no go RT
	- Detection -> discrim -> response -> go/no go 
- 120 ms about to produce a response

Hick’s law
- Number of choices increase, reaction time increases

Contribution
- Idea that you can measure mental processes
- Similar assumptions in moders research
- Neuroimaging methods frequently use subtraction method

Summary
- Cognitive psych is study of mental processes
- Need to figure out the different cognitive processes ( perception, attention, memory)
- Design experiments to understand various cognitive components
- Using different measures (accuracy, reaction time) to infer mental processes

# Tuesday 10/4 Week 2
## Perception basics and pattern recognition

Sensory and perception
- Sensation - stimulation of sense organs
- Perception - selection, organization and interpretation of sensory input
- Psychophysics = the study of how physical stimuli are translated into psych experience

Basic principles
- Three principles emerge with regard to sensation and perception
	- Not one one correspondence between physical and psych reality
	- Sensation and perception are active processes
	- Sens. and perc. are adaptive

Perception
- Dismal - what is actually out there
- Proximal - sensory info impinging on sensory receptors
- Have info about proximal stimulus, not dismal
- Percep. is the construction of model of the world

Perception as induction
- Perception makes inferences to simplify interpretation of sens info
- With partial or missing sens info, percep must fill in gaps to infer
	- (Can't see the back of the cell phone)

Pattern recognition
- Translating patterns of sensory signals into recognizing objects
- Matches memory sensory info

Template matching
- Objects are matches to a template stored in memory
- First proposed by Gestalt Psychologists
- If sensory pattern watches template, object is recognized

Feature analytic approach
- Break stimuli into smaller components
- Recognition based on detection of distinctive features
- Objects are defined by their unique set of features
- Reduces infinite variation in environment to finite categories
- Despite variations of capital A's, they consist of same features

Psych basics for feature theory
- Early 1960s Hubel and Wiesel
	- Micro electrode recordings of axons in primary visual cortex of animals
	- Discovered feature detectors: neurons that responds selectively to lines, edges, etc

Cell types
- Simple cells
	- Receptive field responds to linear stimuli at a particular orientation
- Complex cells
	- Receptive field responds optimally to stimuli at a particular orientation and move in particular direction
- Hypercomplex cells
	- Receptive fields optimally responsive to movement, orientation and length
	- Still more selective than receptive cells 
	- Extending a line outside its receptive field will frequently reduce firing
	- "end stopped cells

Feature analysis in audition
 - Understanding of spoken language is notable example of feature analysis in perception
 - Consonants have definable features
	 - Place of articulation
	 - Voice onset time, when vocal chords start to vibrate

Context in vision
- Word superiority effect
- Better at recognizing letters in words than letters alone, or letters in non words
- Why?
- Both bottom up and top down processes work together in perceiving the letters in a word

Context in Audition
- Problem of invariance
	- No one to one correspondence between acoustic cues and the perceptual events that people perceive
- Pollack and Pickett (1964)
	- Recorded people in conversation, spliced out sections
	- Subjects listening only recognized 54% of the words
	- Subjects recognize near 100% with context

Context in audition (speech)
- Warren (1970)
	- State governors met with their respective legi*latures in the capital city
	- Subjects didn't notice deleted sound

# Thursday 10/6 Week 2
Attention 
- Mental process of concentrating effort on an external or internal event
- Need to efficiently allocate limited cognitive resources toward processing of important info

Metaphors of attention 
- Filter (selective)
- Resource pools (divided)
- Spotlight/zoom lens (spatial)

Cocktail party
- Many conversations all at once
- Can only pay attention to one conversation
- How do you select just one conversation?

Cherry (1953)
- Dichotic listening
	- Stereo headphones
	- Different message to each ear
- Shadowing
	- Repeat speech presented in one of two ears
- How much of the unattended channel do subjects process?
- What noticed about unattended channel?
	- Did notice
		- Change of gender, change to tone, pitch or loudness
	- Didn't notice
		- Change of language

Moray(1959)
- Subjects shadowed one channel
- Unattended channel were word lists repeated up to 35 times in experimental session
- In unattended channel presented
	- "You may stop now" heard by 6%
	- "Name you may stop now" heard by 33%
	- If subjects told to look out for message, heard by 80%

Filtering model - Broadbent (1958)
- Only physical characteristics of channels are extracted and selection based just on phys. chars
- Perceptual analysis largely unlimited in capacity, access to semantics is sharply limited

Attenuation model triesman (1960)
- Some stuff still gets in but it's weaker
- Some things in memory (our name) are already activated a little, even weak singnal can cause us to notice it

What do we know abt capacity limits?
- Open door with right hand
- Can't scratch nose at exact same time
- Selection is make

Processing load and the locus of selection
- High demands of attended stimuli - evidence looks like early selection
- Low demands for attended stimuli - evidence looks like late selection

Attention as resource pools
- In 70s became popular to conceptualize attention as limited pool of resources, can be allocated as needed
- Capacity of attention is amount of resources wanted to allocate
- Divided attention
	- Two things at once

Dual task studies
- Examine capacity limits via dual task studies
- Perform 2 tasks at the same time and manipulate amount of attention allocated to each task
	- Primary and secondairy
- Examine performance tradeoff

Cell phones and driving
- 4x more likely for accident
- More likely to miss red lights
- Effects increase under difficult driving conditions

Single or multiple resource pools
- Initial resource theories suggested that was a single undifferentiated pool if attentional resources
- Sometimes two tasks didn't interfere with each other, even though theoretically they should have
- Suggested that there are multiple pools of resources with each having specific functions

Metaphor for visual attention
- Spotlight of attention
- Flashlight at night ex

Overt and covert orienting
- Overt orienting of attention
	- Fovea is most sensitive region of retina
	- Eyes move to place spatial locations on fovea
	- Look at things we're attending to
- Covert orienting
	- Eye movements are correlated with attention but can be separated

Attention and cueing effects
- Because eyes remain on center fixation, cueing effects reflect movement of visual attention separate from eye movements
- Eye movements and attention are separable
- Are they independent? Correlated?

Rubber band model of attention
- Attention moves to interesting location outside fovea
- Roughly 100 - 200 ms later the eyes move to that location
- 100 - 200 ms later, attention changes

Attention and eye movements
- Can move attention without moving eyes 
- Cant move eyes without moving attention (right before moving eyes)

Inhibition of return
- Attention is slower to return to a previously attended but now unattended location
- Looking for friend in a crowd, looking at new location
- Bias casual system to attend to novel locations instead of previous locations

Objects or locations?
- Attention is inhibited to return to a previously attended but not unattended location
- If object moves, does inhibition travel with the object? Or stay?
- Inhibition of return
	- Attention is with objects not locations
	- Result is to bias out visual system
	- Wants to look for new things

# Week 3 Tuesday 10/11
First exam is next week
### Attention 2
Metaphor for visual attention
- Spotligt of attention

Constraining spotlight
- Can attention zoon in to focus on some things then move out?
- Flanker effect
	- Center letter class example
	- When center letter is differrent, 100ms slower than when all the same
- Attention diffuses, but centered over an are
- Spotlight of attention can change sizes based on the task

Automatic and controlled processing
- Attention can be direc. voluntairly or involu.
- Automat. process. typically don't require attention
	- Built thru practice
- Controlled proce. *do* require attention
- Convienent dichotomy
	- continuum
- Many behaviors are complex interaction of auto and controlled processing

Posnery and Snyder - auto and controlled processing
- Automatic (not thinking about it)
	- Occurs w/o intention
	- Not open to introspection
	- Conumes few resources
	- Operates fast
	- Just Facilitation
- Controlled/Effortful (thinking about it)
	- Only with intention
	- Open to introspection
	- Needs resources
	- Slow
	- facilitation and inhibition

Stroop interference
- Neutral RD < incongruent RT
	- Word reading
		- Fast, effortless
	- Color naming
		- Slow, effortful, controlled

Preattentive processes
- Fast, parallel, unlimited capacity, operated over whole visual field
Attentive processes
- Slow, serial, limited capacity, small portons of visual field (focusing)

Feature and conjunction search
- Feature - preattentive
	- Automatic, Fast, Independent number of distractors
- Conjuction - Attentive
	- Controlled, slow effortful, depents on # of distractors

Feature integration theory
- Anne triesman, Princeton
- Object broken down into features in parallel across visual field
- Attention neded to bind features tgth

Feature integration theory
- Early stage or processing
	- Feature maps code diff dimentions of stimulus
	- Features coded independen. in parallel, and over entire visual field
- Focused attn.
	- Needed to bind info to individual maps into object representations
	- Occurs only in focus of attn. slow, serial

Triesman's feature integration theory
- Accounts for results from feature search
	- Red L among blue letters just look for red activity in map
- Conjunction search
	- Requires attentio to recombine features together
	- Looking for red L among blue L and red Ts

Attentional capture
- Irrelevent sens info can capture attn.
- Presence of salient distractor slows responses to targets by diverting attn

Sustained attn
- Sustaining attn - vigilance
- Very difficult to maintain attn on task for a long period of time
- Performance on many tasks decreases over the first 10 mins on task
	- RT increases and accuracy decreases (reation time)
- Increases in mind wandering and daydreaming
- Importand for applied progs
	- Air traffic control, security guards, TSA

Neuropsychological
- Number of groups tend to be more inconsistent in their preformance relative to control group
- Including
	- ADHD
	- Old people
	- Brain damage
	- Alzheimer's ... etc

Other aspects of attention
- Orienting reflex and habituation (Sokolv 1963)
- Humans and other animals initially orient to novel info
- After repetitions of same stimuli, become habituated to it, less likely to respond
- New stim enters, new reflex

# Week 3 Thursday 10/13
### Sensory memory and imagery
##### this is on the exam
- Perveption vs memor
	- Perception - stimulus is out in the environment
- Often a "sensory trace" of the stilulus after stim is gone
- Traces are termed *sensory memory* tend to be very short lived
	- How long?

General sens memory
- Must have way to briefly retain sens info to allow for later integration
- Doesn't matter what kind of sens info we are talking abt
- Most research focus on visual and auditory mem
	- Iconic memory
	- Echoic memory
		- Echo in head even though sound is gone
	- These systems are easiest to study, so we know the most

Iconic memory
- Sperling (1960)
	- How much info can be retained?
	- How quickly is it lost?

Whole report vs partial report (from Sperling)
- Briefly (50ms) flash array of stimuli
- Whole report: tell me all the letters
- Partial report: tell me one row
	- But you don't know which rowuntil stim is gone
- Vary duration between stim offset and cue onset

Whole report results
- Whole report estimates "size" of memory at 4.5 items
- Subjects reported seeing more than they could say

Sperling's interpretation
- Partial report superior to whole report because it takes time to say the letters
- Rapidly decaying visual score
- Decaying - Lasts a short time regardless of input
	- Lasts 800ms - 1s
- Visual - shouldn't depend on info from other modalities

Problems?
- Just visual? Phonological errors
	- P presented, but participants say E
- Residual neural activity vs memory

Echoic Memory
- Like iconic mem, but in auditory modality
- Rely heavily on serial recall
	- Series of stimuli
	- Scored as correct if correct item in correct position
- Experimental effects: Modality and suffic effects

Terminology
- Serial position curve plots performance as a function of item order
- Primary effect advantage for the first items over items in the middle
- Recency effect: advantage for te last items over items in the middle

Modality effect
- Serial recall as a function of serial position for words eard and words seen
- Recency superior when words read aloud
	- The modality effect refers to a change in the size of the recency effect
- Recalling auditory stimuli lasts longer compared to recalling visual stimuli

Suffix effect
- Extra material, or "suffix" at end of the list
- "when you hear the word 'zero' recall the list"
- Recency effect goes away if suffix resembles speech
- Suffic effect also refers to a change in the recency effect

Echoic memory
- Crowder and morton (1969) proposed serial recall modality and suffix effects a consequence of recall from echoic memory
- Echoic mem is auditory store that holds info for a short time (2s)
- Recency predicted to be a function of unique info in echoic mem
	- Modality effect
- Echoic mem subject to interference
	- Suffix effect

Problems with echoic mem
- Suffic effect depends on how suffix interpreted
- Ayers (1979)
- 3 groups: Control, Musical suffix, speech suffic
- Musical and speech got same syllable (wa)
- Suffix effect only when interpreted as speech
- Singers and lip-readers show suffix effect

Conclusions about sens mem
- Sens mem studied exclusively in visual and auditory modalities
- Sperling's iconic mem (vision)
- Chowder's echoic mem (audition)
- Other types of sensory mems

### Mental imagery
Mental imagery 
- Experiencing a sensory impression in the absense of sens input

Problems posed by imagery
- Generation
	- How many images created?
- Inspection
	- Once created, what mechanisms allow access to info?
- Maintenance 
	- Images seem to face, what keeps them active?
- Trannsform
	- How are we able to manipulate images and objects

Mental rotation
- Roger shepard, stanford uni
- Decide if two stimuli are the same or diff
- Stimuli are presented at diff orientations
- Measure time required for same/diff response
- Found that RT was liearly related to degree difference in rotation
- As if observers mentally rotated one figure before comparing with other

Retreiving info from images
- Memorize images with several objects
- After memorizing, participants asked to close eyes and "look" at one part of the object
- Presented w/ prompt (is there an achor? is there a motor?) - and respond "yes/no"
- RT for far part > RT for near part
	- Mentally traveling along the object to recall different features

Depictive theory
- Depictive representations
	- Visual 
	- Can't refer to nonpicturable events or relations
	- Specific instances only (don't visualize the class of "balls" you visualize a specific one)
	- **Functional isommorphism** between real visual info and visual imagery

Propositional theory
- Propositional
	- Objects and relations between objects
	- Ball is on the box
	- Propositions can be about specific objects or tey can represent whole classes of objects
	- Subjective experience of imageru isn't relavent to understanding the cognitive processes

Why the attachment to propositions
- Computational theory of mind
	- Easy to program propositions
	- What does mental imagery mean to computer?
	- who looks at image?
- Retrieving info from images
	- Time to retrieve depends on number of links

The counterattack
- Pylyshyn (1981)
	- Instructions typically say "scan the pic" look from one object to another
	- Participants interpret this to mean they should behave as if images were just like real visual stim
		- Tactic knowledge explaination
	- Can assume propositional representation and get sim results

How might imagery be implemented in brain?
- If representations are "depictive," than they perseve spatial relations present in real vision
- Where in the brain are representations that are spatially organized - vis cortex

How might imagery be implemented in brain?
- 2 conditions
	- Participants look at complex visual display
	- Participants imagine complex visual display

Pupil and imagery
- Pulils constrict to light, dialate to darkness
- (2014 study) had participants stare at blank gray screen and imagine diff scenes
- Pupils adjust to imaginary light
	- (imagine sunny sky, imagine dark room - pupil changed size)

# Week 4 Thursday 10/20
### Modal model 1

What is memory
- Multiple defs
- Like attention everyone knows what it is
- Memory as representation
	- Individual mems in head
- Memory as process
	- Building and retreiving memories as you need them
- Memory as storehouse
	- Memory is not a single thing, multiple storages of memory

Memory as replesentation
- Individual internal representations of what has been learned
- What makes up a memory?
	- Multidimentional attributes
	- Visual, tactile, auditory, olfactory, semantic, temporal, emotional, etc
	- Every memory has all of these components in it

Memory as process
- Memory is also the process that leads to remembering
- Aquisition/learning/encoding of info
- Storage and maintenance of info
- Retrieval of info

Melton (1963)
- Encoding -> storage -> retreival

Memory as storehouse
- Memory is place where representations are stored
- Not only in brain, but in conceptual terms
- Where we "look" for specific mems

Broadbent's model
- One of first explicit models of memory
- Influenced by information theory
- Proposed three main structs
- S-system
	- Sensory info
- P-system
	- Consciousness, limited capacity
- Secondary memory
	- Everything else

Important features
- Dual-component view of memory
- Limited capacity short term mem
- Info rapidly list from limited capacity component
	- Need to maintain info via rehersal
- Unlimited capacity long term memory
![[Pasted image 20221020141718.png]]

Capacity limit/span
- What is the capacity of short-term memory and how do we measure it?
- Memory span: Number of items we can recite back perfectly without error 50% of the time

Miller (1956) 7 +- 2
- Memory span is typically around 7 +- 2 items
- A magical number? - his suggestion
- Cowan (2001) 4 +- 1
- Because of capacity limit need a way to combine small bits of into into large bits (chunking)
	- Take small bits of info and combine them into larger, more meaningful bits of info
	- IBMFBICIAIRS

Rate of info loss
- How is info lost from short term memory?
	- Most research suggests items are *displaced* from short term mem by incoming info
	- FIFO property
	- First thing in short term memory is kicked out and replaced
	- Once box is full, something has to go?
- How quickly is info lost?

Brown-Peterson
- Brown(1958), Peterson & Peterson(1959)
- Recall constonant trigrams after a delay
- Distracting task to prevent rehersal
	- Given number, count backwards by 3s 
- Variable delay: 3, 6, 9, ...
- IVs: delay vs non delay, length of delay
![[Pasted image 20221020142543.png]]

Rehersal Maintenance
- How do we prevent loss from short term mem?
	- Covertly rehearse the info
- What is the code for short-term memory?
- Conrad 1964 and Wicklegren 1965 suggested the code was acoustic
	- What are you rehearsing? The word? The meaning, sound? etc...
- Inner speech to remember *sound* of the words

Baddeley (1966)
- 4 lists
- Phonologically similar: sound alike
	- Cap, map ... etc
- Sematically similar: same meaning
	- Big, huge, etc..
- Control: unrelated words
- If code is acoustic, then it should be *difficult* to rehearse words that sound alike

Basic ideas about modal model
- 2-3 main components of memory
- Sensory stores
- Limited capacity short-term mem
- Info rapidly lost from limited capacity component (20 seconds)
	- Need to maintain info via rehersal
- Unlimited capacity long term mem
- Called the *modal model* becasue people has the same basic ideas 

Atkson and Shiffrin (1968)
- Most influential dual-component model
- Specific mathematical formulation
- STM limited capacity store, short duration
- Control processes operate on STM
- LTM unlimited capacity, info lost due to interference or search failures

![[Pasted image 20221020143715.png]]

Structural vs processing components
- Structural components
	- Sensory stores, STM, LTM
	- Don't change
- Processing components
	- Control processes that operate on STM
	- Change depending on task requirements
	- Maintenance (rehersal) vs retreival

Controlled processing in STM
- Control processes maintain info in STM
- Rehersal is main one
- The longer in STM, the more transfer to LTM

Rundus (1971)
- Test to see if rehersal predicts liklihood of later recall
- S's given to free recall
- S's told to rehearse outloud
- Counted frequency with which each individual item had been rehearsed
- More rehearsals should lead to better recall later

STM
- Limited capacity store
	- 4-7 items
- Short duration
- New info bumps out older info
- Need to rehearse items in STM to transfer them to LTM system

LTM
- Unlimited capacity
- Durable
- Includes all mems
	- Knowledge, personal info, etc
- Info never bumped out or lost
- Info forgotted via interference or search failures
- Info needs to be retrieved from LTM back into STM for report

# Tuesday Week 5 10/25
### Modal model part 2

Perdictions
- Because of basic struct of modal model, makea specific predictions in terms of how info will be stored and reviewed
- Most predictions relied on use of free recall serial position functions

Free Recall
- Series of stim
- Written or verbal recall
- Scored as correct if correct item is recalled regardless of positoin
- Unlike serial recall, correct only if in correct position
	- Serial recall is recalling things in exact order they were presented in
- Can start at last word, first word, anywhere
![[Pasted image 20221025140709.png]]

Modal model account
- Serial position curve result of recalling items from 2 stores
- First recalled in STM, then LTM
	- Try and recall any info recalled in long term
- Need two diff storange systems to account for results

Modal model for privacy
- First items rehearse a lot
- Eventually is bumped out, short term mem overloaded
- Most rehearsals result in better transfers to long term memory
- Rundus(1971)
	- Words rehearsed the most, remembered the best
- graph looks like  a U

Modal model of recency
- Recency effect due to fact that items presented at end are still in STM at time of recall
- 40 items, everyone remembers last item perfectly
- Leads to nearly perfect recall of these items
- Modal predicts that last items shows should be first recalled

Abolishing recency
- According to modal model, if we kick items out, recency should go away
 - What happens if we emptu STM before allowed to recall?
	- Sould abolish recency effect
	- Glanzer and Cunitz (1966)
	- Immediate free recall
		- Recall items immediately after presentation
	- Delayed free recall
		- Recall items after delay filled with distracting activity

Immediate vs delayed free recall
- Immediate recall uses STM + LTM
- Delayed recall uses only LTM
- Recency effect due to STM

Final free recall
- Last items presented still in STM which leads to recency
- Items should get fewer rehearsals leading to less transfer to LTM than primary items
- What happens if we test recall much later?
		- Craik (1970)
		- Give words, instruct participants to read newspaper for 5 mins
		- ^^ called "final free recall"
		- Final recall of the experiment

Modal model and free recall
- Modal model successfully accounted for various apects of free recall
	- Accounts for primacy and recency
	- Absense of recency in delayed free recall
	- Negative recency
- Suggested dual-store model gives best account of the data
- Not without challenges

Problems w/ modal model
- Recency effect
- Is recency effect due to unloading items from STM?

Bjork and Whitten methods
- Free recall but have participants perform secondary task before and after each word
- [[Continuous distractor task]]

Problems w/ problems
- Are short and LTM recency effects the same?
- Some models suggest they are based on separate mechs
	- Some support
	- Look the same, but actually diff things
- LTM recency effects are almost always smaller than ST recency effects

Neuropsychological evidence
- Individuals w/ specific neuro conditions provide evidence for a distinction between STM and LTM
- Neuroimaging work corroborates thist of the data
 Not without challenges

at of the data
 Not without challenges

Brain areas important for memory
- Prefromtal coretex
	- Important for short term mem
- Medial temporal lobes
	- Important for LTM
	- Damage hyppocampus results in amnesia

Amnesia
- Hallmarks
	- Impairments are multimodal
	- Immediate mem is intact
	- Impairment occurs against backgrount of intact perceptual and intellectual functioning
- Types
	- Anterograde 
		- Inability to learn new info following brain trauma
	- Retrograde
		- Inability to remember info learned prior to brain trauma

Spared immediate mem
- Carlesimo (1996)
	- Found that amnesics and controls didn't deffer in recency in IFR
	- Do differ in recency in CDFR

Patient HM
- Had severe epilepsy
- Bilateral temporal lobectomy in 1953 (age 27)
- Couldn't learn new things
- Could remember some things from remote past (prior to age 16)
- Could remember skills and facts

What was wrong with HM
- Hippocampus missing
- Surrounding cortex (including EC) gone
- Amygdla gone

HM had profound anterograde amnesia
- Performed very poorly on lab memory tasks
- Had no recollection of anything after 1953
- Did not know words that entered the lexicon after injury

What's ok with HM?
- Normal perception
- Normal speech, language perception
- Above average intelligence
- Immediate mem
	- Normal digit span
	- Can carry on conversation

# Week 5 Thursday 10/27
### Working memory

Working mem
- STM in modal model didn't explain complex behaviors too well
	- Too simplistic
- What is STM for?
- Need for things like learning, reasoning, reading etc
- Need for more dynamic STM
	- Only rehearded words over and over
- Typical def
	- Working mem may be defined as system for temp maitenance and manipulation of info, necessary for performance of such complex cognitive activities as comprehenstion, learning, and reasoning(1992)

Baddeley and Hitch (1974)
- 2 "Storage systems" - places to hold info for diff types
	- One for phonological info and one for spatial info
- "Central executive" to determine what info goes where
- "Phonological loop" has received most attention

Dual task stidies
- SS perform primary task while simultaneously performing secondary task which is presumed to take STM capacity
- 7 words
- Overt rehearsal of secondary task ensures subjects aren't switching between tasks

Baddeley and Hitch (1974)
- Ss remember and overtly rehearse sequences of 0-8 digits
- At same time subjects perform rimple reasoning task
- Dual task results imply system responsible for rehersal can't be same as system rsponsible for learning/reasoning
- Baddeley and Hitch - performance on rehearsal based tasks involved a speech based system
- Phonological loop - used to recycle info

Phonological loop
- (AKA articulatory loop) comprises two components
- Phonological store
	- Holds small amount of speech based info
- Articulatory control process
	- Based on inner speech

Phonological similarity effect
- Words sound the same, hard to remember
- Look at Baddely from last week notes
- Recall of chars or words impaired if phonologycally similar
- PVCGE harder to recall than XRFYZ
- Words w/ visual and auditory presentation
	- ACP translates into phonological
- Effect can be explained because items in phonological store based on phonological codes

Irrelevant speech effect
- Hard to remember list of words when someone is speaking in the background
- Colle and Welsh (1976) 
	- Immediate recall of digits impaired if accompanied by sound of someone reading German
	- Explanation - unnattended phono material can gain access to phono store
- Salame and Baddeley (1987) 
	- Hurts more when trying to remember numbers when someone is saying words that rhyme
	- "One two" while someone saying "tun woo"

Word length effect
- Easier to remember list of short words vs list of long words
- Finite amount if "tape" on the loop
- Long words use up more tape
- Fir fewer long words into loop than short words
- #lookfordiagram

Phonologial loop
- Acounts for phono similarity effect
	- ACP rehearses items, phono somilar items interfeer with each other
- Account for irrelevant speech effect
	- Gets suck in the loop
- Accounts for word length effect
	- Can only rehearse items so fast

What is phono loop for?
- Learning to read
	- Kids w/ impaired reading ability have reduced memory spans
- Language comprehension
	- STM patients such as TB have difficulty in comprehending verpose or comples sentances
- Vocab aquisition
	- Strong correlation between non-word repition and vocab size

Visuo-spatial sketchpad
- Stores and manipulates visual-spatial info
- Needed when info can't be recorded into phono representaiton
- Mental rotation of objects
- Other visual0spatial info interferes
	- Verbal info does not

Brooks (1968)
- Verbal task: identify each word in sentance as noun or not
	- A bird in the hand is not in the bush
- Spatial task
	- Imagine letter and starting at bottom left, indicate whether corner is at extreme bottom or top

Central exacutive
- Model suggets CE coordinates actifity of two storage systems
- Other potential roles for CE include:
	- Coordinating retrieval strats, selective attn, temp activation of LTM, supression of habitual responses
- Thought to be associated w/ frontal lobes

Episodic Buffer
- "limitec capacity temp storage sys capable of integrating info from variety of sources"
- Controlled by CE
- Feeds info into and retrieves info from LTS
- Uses common "multidimentional" code

Functions of PFC
- Prefrontal cortex seems to be important in maintaining task relevant info over short term
- May be particularly important in maintaining info in presence of potent distraction and interference
- Delayed response task

Functions of prefrontal cortex
- Monkeys trained over 100s of trials to perform delayed response task
- Moneys lesioned in PFC
- Monkeys w/ PDC lesions show decreased performance
- Suggest that PFC is involved in working mem

Delayed auditory sample task
- Two beeps
- Subjects compare if they are same or different after a longer delay after each trial

### Memory as processes

#### Encoding

Melton 1963
- Encoding -> storage -> retreival

What is encoded?
- What is the info that gets into the system?
- Attributes/features
- Encoding reps the proc. by which the attributes of mem are established
- Binding together of diff attributes into representation
	- "Episode"

Auto and controlled encoding
- You remember things you pay attention to
- Automatically encode great deal of info
- You can also focus attention on a subset of info for better encoding (controlled)
	- Studying
	- Focus attention and intend to get info into mem

Rehearsel
- Easiest way to intentionally get info into system is rehearsal
- **Maintenance rehearsal**
	- Simply repeating items over and over again
		- Phonological loop

Levels of processing
- Problems w/ modal model lead to development of Levels of processing approach (Craik and Lockhart 1972)
- Mem depends on how you process and learn info
- Deeper the processing, better the retention

LOP framework
- Types of processing
	- Orthographic
		- Shallow level of processing, poor retention
		- Visual
	- Phonological
		- Medium level of processing, medium retention
		- Sound
	- Semantic
		- Deep level of processing, good retention
		- Understanding the meaning

Doubts about depth
- Does samantic processing always lead to best retention?
- Sometimes rhyming tasks lead to excellent retention
- Retrieval
	- Need to get the info back out again too

Distinctiveness
- Hypothesis
	- Mem is determined in pary by how well the info encoded specifies event being reconstructed
- More distinctive items are, better they are remembered
- Can be things like color words are presented in, gender of speaker

Von restorff effect
- The finding that if one item in list differs from others, better recalled
- Item is especially distinct and stands out at recall

Organization
- Process of grouping discrete, individual items into larger units based on specific relationships among items
- Look for similarities among items
- Chunking
- Allows you to reduce number of items that have been recalled

Elaboration
- Linking a stim to other info at time of encoding
	- Link presented info with preexisting knowledge
- Basica of education
- Generating your own examples for a given topic

Self referent encoding
- Making the paterial personally relevent
	- Better memory
- Rogers, Kuiper and Kirker (1977)
- Orienting tasks (structural, phonemic, semantic) on list of adjectives
- Also personal relevance
	- Does this word describe you?

Spaciong effects
- Spacing of learning is important
- Everything else being equal
	- Distributed encoding leads to better retention than massed encoding

Testing effects
- Taking test increases long term mem more than simply studying

#### Retrieval

What is retrieved?
- Encoding represents process by which attributes of mem are established
- Binding together of diff attributes

Transfer appropriate processing
- Whatever processing was done at encoding, it must transfer to retreival

Context as a clue
- Distinction between content and context
- Context could be things in room or "internal" stim
- Or temporal context
	- Info preceding items

Encoding context effects
- Recall is best if test context is sim to learning context
- Classroom effect (Abernathy 1940)
	- Mem is better if tested in same room as learning was done

Context affects
- Context often not praticularly informitive term
- Intrinsic context
	- Features which are integral part of target stim
- Extrinsic
	- Other features present at time of encoding (time, place, cognitive state)
- Inability to place a face without a certain context

Temporal context
- During encoding, items associated w/ temporal context present
	- Time tags
- At retrieval, trying to reinstate temporal context to recall the items
	- Mental time travel
	- Mentally going back to that time point
- Current temporal context "cues" which items should be recalled

Lag recency effect
- After recalling given word, recalled tends to come from nearby serial position
- Asymmetry
- Current item's context cues next item

Internal context: mood congruency
- Mood correlated with memory

State dependent memory
- Pharmacological state behaves like context
- Vodka experiment
- Drink at encoding or retrieval or both, or not at all
- If intoxicated, better at retrieval than encoding
