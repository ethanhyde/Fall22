Why is cognition important?
- Basic part of what it is to be human
- Constantly using cognitive systems, awake or asleep
- Memory and attention loss (aging, alzheimer’s, brain insult)

A Mix of:
- Experimental psychology
- Comp sci
- Philosophy
- Linguistics
- Neuroscience

Right tools for asking the right questions in a way to get an answer
- How does memory work? Why do you forget something?
- What is attention? Is attention one thing or lots of other things?
- Computers get right answer on some things, while humans always get the wrong answers

# Thursday 09/29 Week 1
Early history
- A lot of psychology was influenced by psychology
- Aristotle began writing about the associations in memory
- British build on this idea, and they started linking associations in memory
- Brain picks up on associations to make sense of what is happening

German Physicists
- Helmholtz: Trichromatic theory of color vision
- Fechner: Psychophysics
- Contribution to cognitive psychology
	- Use of scientific/experimental methods
- Limitation
	- Limited to study of simple mental processes (which weight is heavier)

The Problem
- Traditionally 3 things we can observe
	- Ourselves
	- Stimulus response relationships
	- Physiology
	- Stimuli -> response

Solutions to problem
- Introspection
	- Look inwards to figure it out
	- Difficult to verify, (colorblind)
	- Subjective, private not public
	- End product, not the process
- Behaviorism
	- Stimulus response relationships
	- If you cant see something, don’t talk about it
	- Only focuses on stimulus response relationships
	- Dog bell steak
- Cognitivism
	- Can’t directly observe mental processes
	- Infer what is happening inside the mind
	- Try and figure out what is happening, tight experiments
- Neuroscience
	- Brain activity

Instrumental/Operational conditioning
- If something is desirable, the relationship is strengthened 

Behaviorism
- Psychology as science of behavior

Problems with behaviorist approach
- Can’t account for diversity of human behavior
	- Language, navigation
- Perhaps limitation to observable isn’t necessarily scientific
	- Electrons, Genes
- Behaviorism was complete flop for applied issues during WWII
	- Staring at radar, false alarms

What is cognitive psychology?
- The scientific study of mental processes
- Includes: 
	- Perception, attention, memory, language, reasoning, problem solving, division making
- Underlying assumption
	- Cognition is like a computer program
	- Cognitive psychologists need to figure out the program
	- Intelligent behavior is decomposable into parts
	- Each part easier to understand than the whole
	- Figure out each little component then build it back up to understand
	- All elements fit together

Information processing stages
- Stimulus -> processing -> more processing -> response
- Each stage
	- Receives information from the previous stage, transfers it, and send info to the next stage

Stages of memory
- Encoding -> storage -> Retrieval
- Studying for an exam to remember things
- Retrieve information on exam day

Two questions
- What are the stages in a task?
- How long does each stage last?

Subtraction method
- Simple RT
	- Detection -> response -> simple RT
- Choice RT
	- Detection -> discrim -> selection -> response -> choice RT
- go/no go RT
	- Detection -> discrim -> response -> go/no go 
- 120 ms about to produce a response

Hick’s law
- Number of choices increase, reaction time increases

Contribution
- Idea that you can measure mental processes
- Similar assumptions in moders research
- Neuroimaging methods frequently use subtraction method

Summary
- Cognitive psych is study of mental processes
- Need to figure out the different cognitive processes ( perception, attention, memory)
- Design experiments to understand various cognitive components
- Using different measures (accuracy, reaction time) to infer mental processes

# Tuesday 10/4 Week 2
## Perception basics and pattern recognition

Sensory and perception
- Sensation - stimulation of sense organs
- Perception - selection, organization and interpretation of sensory input
- Psychophysics = the study of how physical stimuli are translated into psych experience

Basic principles
- Three principles emerge with regard to sensation and perception
	- Not one one correspondence between physical and psych reality
	- Sensation and perception are active processes
	- Sens. and perc. are adaptive

Perception
- Dismal - what is actually out there
- Proximal - sensory info impinging on sensory receptors
- Have info about proximal stimulus, not dismal
- Percep. is the construction of model of the world

Perception as induction
- Perception makes inferences to simplify interpretation of sens info
- With partial or missing sens info, percep must fill in gaps to infer
	- (Can't see the back of the cell phone)

Pattern recognition
- Translating patterns of sensory signals into recognizing objects
- Matches memory sensory info

Template matching
- Objects are matches to a template stored in memory
- First proposed by Gestalt Psychologists
- If sensory pattern watches template, object is recognized

Feature analytic approach
- Break stimuli into smaller components
- Recognition based on detection of distinctive features
- Objects are defined by their unique set of features
- Reduces infinite variation in environment to finite categories
- Despite variations of capital A's, they consist of same features

Psych basics for feature theory
- Early 1960s Hubel and Wiesel
	- Micro electrode recordings of axons in primary visual cortex of animals
	- Discovered feature detectors: neurons that responds selectively to lines, edges, etc

Cell types
- Simple cells
	- Receptive field responds to linear stimuli at a particular orientation
- Complex cells
	- Receptive field responds optimally to stimuli at a particular orientation and move in particular direction
- Hypercomplex cells
	- Receptive fields optimally responsive to movement, orientation and length
	- Still more selective than receptive cells 
	- Extending a line outside its receptive field will frequently reduce firing
	- "end stopped cells

Feature analysis in audition
 - Understanding of spoken language is notable example of feature analysis in perception
 - Consonants have definable features
	 - Place of articulation
	 - Voice onset time, when vocal chords start to vibrate

Context in vision
- Word superiority effect
- Better at recognizing letters in words than letters alone, or letters in non words
- Why?
- Both bottom up and top down processes work together in perceiving the letters in a word

Context in Audition
- Problem of invariance
	- No one to one correspondence between acoustic cues and the perceptual events that people perceive
- Pollack and Pickett (1964)
	- Recorded people in conversation, spliced out sections
	- Subjects listening only recognized 54% of the words
	- Subjects recognize near 100% with context

Context in audition (speech)
- Warren (1970)
	- State governors met with their respective legi*latures in the capital city
	- Subjects didn't notice deleted sound

# Thursday 10/6 Week 2
Attention 
- Mental process of concentrating effort on an external or internal event
- Need to efficiently allocate limited cognitive resources toward processing of important info

Metaphors of attention 
- Filter (selective)
- Resource pools (divided)
- Spotlight/zoom lens (spatial)

Cocktail party
- Many conversations all at once
- Can only pay attention to one conversation
- How do you select just one conversation?

Cherry (1953)
- Dichotic listening
	- Stereo headphones
	- Different message to each ear
- Shadowing
	- Repeat speech presented in one of two ears
- How much of the unattended channel do subjects process?
- What noticed about unattended channel?
	- Did notice
		- Change of gender, change to tone, pitch or loudness
	- Didn't notice
		- Change of language

Moray(1959)
- Subjects shadowed one channel
- Unattended channel were word lists repeated up to 35 times in experimental session
- In unattended channel presented
	- "You may stop now" heard by 6%
	- "Name you may stop now" heard by 33%
	- If subjects told to look out for message, heard by 80%

Filtering model - Broadbent (1958)
- Only physical characteristics of channels are extracted and selection based just on phys. chars
- Perceptual analysis largely unlimited in capacity, access to semantics is sharply limited

Attenuation model triesman (1960)
- Some stuff still gets in but it's weaker
- Some things in memory (our name) are already activated a little, even weak singnal can cause us to notice it

What do we know abt capacity limits?
- Open door with right hand
- Can't scratch nose at exact same time
- Selection is make

Processing load and the locus of selection
- High demands of attended stimuli - evidence looks like early selection
- Low demands for attended stimuli - evidence looks like late selection

Attention as resource pools
- In 70s became popular to conceptualize attention as limited pool of resources, can be allocated as needed
- Capacity of attention is amount of resources wanted to allocate
- Divided attention
	- Two things at once

Dual task studies
- Examine capacity limits via dual task studies
- Perform 2 tasks at the same time and manipulate amount of attention allocated to each task
	- Primary and secondairy
- Examine performance tradeoff

Cell phones and driving
- 4x more likely for accident
- More likely to miss red lights
- Effects increase under difficult driving conditions

Single or multiple resource pools
- Initial resource theories suggested that was a single undifferentiated pool if attentional resources
- Sometimes two tasks didn't interfere with each other, even though theoretically they should have
- Suggested that there are multiple pools of resources with each having specific functions

Metaphor for visual attention
- Spotlight of attention
- Flashlight at night ex

Overt and covert orienting
- Overt orienting of attention
	- Fovea is most sensitive region of retina
	- Eyes move to place spatial locations on fovea
	- Look at things we're attending to
- Covert orienting
	- Eye movements are correlated with attention but can be separated

Attention and cueing effects
- Because eyes remain on center fixation, cueing effects reflect movement of visual attention separate from eye movements
- Eye movements and attention are separable
- Are they independent? Correlated?

Rubber band model of attention
- Attention moves to interesting location outside fovea
- Roughly 100 - 200 ms later the eyes move to that location
- 100 - 200 ms later, attention changes

Attention and eye movements
- Can move attention without moving eyes 
- Cant move eyes without moving attention (right before moving eyes)

Inhibition of return
- Attention is slower to return to a previously attended but now unattended location
- Looking for friend in a crowd, looking at new location
- Bias casual system to attend to novel locations instead of previous locations

Objects or locations?
- Attention is inhibited to return to a previously attended but not unattended location
- If object moves, does inhibition travel with the object? Or stay?
- Inhibition of return
	- Attention is with objects not locations
	- Result is to bias out visual system
	- Wants to look for new things

# Week 3 Tuesday 10/11
First exam is next week
### Attention 2
Metaphor for visual attention
- Spotligt of attention

Constraining spotlight
- Can attention zoon in to focus on some things then move out?
- Flanker effect
	- Center letter class example
	- When center letter is differrent, 100ms slower than when all the same
- Attention diffuses, but centered over an are
- Spotlight of attention can change sizes based on the task

Automatic and controlled processing
- Attention can be direc. voluntairly or involu.
- Automat. process. typically don't require attention
	- Built thru practice
- Controlled proce. *do* require attention
- Convienent dichotomy
	- continuum
- Many behaviors are complex interaction of auto and controlled processing

Posnery and Snyder - auto and controlled processing
- Automatic (not thinking about it)
	- Occurs w/o intention
	- Not open to introspection
	- Conumes few resources
	- Operates fast
	- Just Facilitation
- Controlled/Effortful (thinking about it)
	- Only with intention
	- Open to introspection
	- Needs resources
	- Slow
	- facilitation and inhibition

Stroop interference
- Neutral RD < incongruent RT
	- Word reading
		- Fast, effortless
	- Color naming
		- Slow, effortful, controlled

Preattentive processes
- Fast, parallel, unlimited capacity, operated over whole visual field
Attentive processes
- Slow, serial, limited capacity, small portons of visual field (focusing)

Feature and conjunction search
- Feature - preattentive
	- Automatic, Fast, Independent number of distractors
- Conjuction - Attentive
	- Controlled, slow effortful, depents on # of distractors

Feature integration theory
- Anne triesman, Princeton
- Object broken down into features in parallel across visual field
- Attention neded to bind features tgth

Feature integration theory
- Early stage or processing
	- Feature maps code diff dimentions of stimulus
	- Features coded independen. in parallel, and over entire visual field
- Focused attn.
	- Needed to bind info to individual maps into object representations
	- Occurs only in focus of attn. slow, serial

Triesman's feature integration theory
- Accounts for results from feature search
	- Red L among blue letters just look for red activity in map
- Conjunction search
	- Requires attentio to recombine features together
	- Looking for red L among blue L and red Ts

Attentional capture
- Irrelevent sens info can capture attn.
- Presence of salient distractor slows responses to targets by diverting attn

Sustained attn
- Sustaining attn - vigilance
- Very difficult to maintain attn on task for a long period of time
- Performance on many tasks decreases over the first 10 mins on task
	- RT increases and accuracy decreases (reation time)
- Increases in mind wandering and daydreaming
- Importand for applied progs
	- Air traffic control, security guards, TSA

Neuropsychological
- Number of groups tend to be more inconsistent in their preformance relative to control group
- Including
	- ADHD
	- Old people
	- Brain damage
	- Alzheimer's ... etc

Other aspects of attention
- Orienting reflex and habituation (Sokolv 1963)
- Humans and other animals initially orient to novel info
- After repetitions of same stimuli, become habituated to it, less likely to respond
- New stim enters, new reflex

# Week 3 Thursday 10/13
### Sensory memory and imagery
##### this is on the exam
- Perveption vs memor
	- Perception - stimulus is out in the environment
- Often a "sensory trace" of the stilulus after stim is gone
- Traces are termed *sensory memory* tend to be very short lived
	- How long?

General sens memory
- Must have way to briefly retain sens info to allow for later integration
- Doesn't matter what kind of sens info we are talking abt
- Most research focus on visual and auditory mem
	- Iconic memory
	- Echoic memory
		- Echo in head even though sound is gone
	- These systems are easiest to study, so we know the most

Iconic memory
- Sperling (1960)
	- How much info can be retained?
	- How quickly is it lost?

Whole report vs partial report (from Sperling)
- Briefly (50ms) flash array of stimuli
- Whole report: tell me all the letters
- Partial report: tell me one row
	- But you don't know which rowuntil stim is gone
- Vary duration between stim offset and cue onset

Whole report results
- Whole report estimates "size" of memory at 4.5 items
- Subjects reported seeing more than they could say

Sperling's interpretation
- Partial report superior to whole report because it takes time to say the letters
- Rapidly decaying visual score
- Decaying - Lasts a short time regardless of input
	- Lasts 800ms - 1s
- Visual - shouldn't depend on info from other modalities

Problems?
- Just visual? Phonological errors
	- P presented, but participants say E
- Residual neural activity vs memory

Echoic Memory
- Like iconic mem, but in auditory modality
- Rely heavily on serial recall
	- Series of stimuli
	- Scored as correct if correct item in correct position
- Experimental effects: Modality and suffic effects

Terminology
- Serial position curve plots performance as a function of item order
- Primary effect advantage for the first items over items in the middle
- Recency effect: advantage for te last items over items in the middle

Modality effect
- Serial recall as a function of serial position for words eard and words seen
- Recency superior when words read aloud
	- The modality effect refers to a change in the size of the recency effect
- Recalling auditory stimuli lasts longer compared to recalling visual stimuli

Suffix effect
- Extra material, or "suffix" at end of the list
- "when you hear the word 'zero' recall the list"
- Recency effect goes away if suffix resembles speech
- Suffic effect also refers to a change in the recency effect

Echoic memory
- Crowder and morton (1969) proposed serial recall modality and suffix effects a consequence of recall from echoic memory
- Echoic mem is auditory store that holds info for a short time (2s)
- Recency predicted to be a function of unique info in echoic mem
	- Modality effect
- Echoic mem subject to interference
	- Suffix effect

Problems with echoic mem
- Suffic effect depends on how suffix interpreted
- Ayers (1979)
- 3 groups: Control, Musical suffix, speech suffic
- Musical and speech got same syllable (wa)
- Suffix effect only when interpreted as speech
- Singers and lip-readers show suffix effect

Conclusions about sens mem
- Sens mem studied exclusively in visual and auditory modalities
- Sperling's iconic mem (vision)
- Chowder's echoic mem (audition)
- Other types of sensory mems

### Mental imagery
Mental imagery 
- Experiencing a sensory impression in the absense of sens input

Problems posed by imagery
- Generation
	- How many images created?
- Inspection
	- Once created, what mechanisms allow access to info?
- Maintenance 
	- Images seem to face, what keeps them active?
- Trannsform
	- How are we able to manipulate images and objects

Mental rotation
- Roger shepard, stanford uni
- Decide if two stimuli are the same or diff
- Stimuli are presented at diff orientations
- Measure time required for same/diff response
- Found that RT was liearly related to degree difference in rotation
- As if observers mentally rotated one figure before comparing with other

Retreiving info from images
- Memorize images with several objects
- After memorizing, participants asked to close eyes and "look" at one part of the object
- Presented w/ prompt (is there an achor? is there a motor?) - and respond "yes/no"
- RT for far part > RT for near part
	- Mentally traveling along the object to recall different features

Depictive theory
- Depictive representations
	- Visual 
	- Can't refer to nonpicturable events or relations
	- Specific instances only (don't visualize the class of "balls" you visualize a specific one)
	- **Functional isommorphism** between real visual info and visual imagery

Propositional theory
- Propositional
	- Objects and relations between objects
	- Ball is on the box
	- Propositions can be about specific objects or tey can represent whole classes of objects
	- Subjective experience of imageru isn't relavent to understanding the cognitive processes

Why the attachment to propositions
- Computational theory of mind
	- Easy to program propositions
	- What does mental imagery mean to computer?
	- who looks at image?
- Retrieving info from images
	- Time to retrieve depends on number of links

The counterattack
- Pylyshyn (1981)
	- Instructions typically say "scan the pic" look from one object to another
	- Participants interpret this to mean they should behave as if images were just like real visual stim
		- Tactic knowledge explaination
	- Can assume propositional representation and get sim results

How might imagery be implemented in brain?
- If representations are "depictive," than they perseve spatial relations present in real vision
- Where in the brain are representations that are spatially organized - vis cortex

How might imagery be implemented in brain?
- 2 conditions
	- Participants look at complex visual display
	- Participants imagine complex visual display

Pupil and imagery
- Pulils constrict to light, dialate to darkness
- (2014 study) had participants stare at blank gray screen and imagine diff scenes
- Pupils adjust to imaginary light
	- (imagine sunny sky, imagine dark room - pupil changed size)
