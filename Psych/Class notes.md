Why is cognition important?
- Basic part of what it is to be human
- Constantly using cognitive systems, awake or asleep
- Memory and attention loss (aging, alzheimer’s, brain insult)

A Mix of:
- Experimental psychology
- Comp sci
- Philosophy
- Linguistics
- Neuroscience

Right tools for asking the right questions in a way to get an answer
- How does memory work? Why do you forget something?
- What is attention? Is attention one thing or lots of other things?
- Computers get right answer on some things, while humans always get the wrong answers

# Thursday 09/29 Week 1
Early history
- A lot of psychology was influenced by psychology
- Aristotle began writing about the associations in memory
- British build on this idea, and they started linking associations in memory
- Brain picks up on associations to make sense of what is happening

German Physicists
- Helmholtz: Trichromatic theory of color vision
- Fechner: Psychophysics
- Contribution to cognitive psychology
	- Use of scientific/experimental methods
- Limitation
	- Limited to study of simple mental processes (which weight is heavier)

The Problem
- Traditionally 3 things we can observe
	- Ourselves
	- Stimulus response relationships
	- Physiology
	- Stimuli -> response

Solutions to problem
- Introspection
	- Look inwards to figure it out
	- Difficult to verify, (colorblind)
	- Subjective, private not public
	- End product, not the process
- Behaviorism
	- Stimulus response relationships
	- If you cant see something, don’t talk about it
	- Only focuses on stimulus response relationships
	- Dog bell steak
- Cognitivism
	- Can’t directly observe mental processes
	- Infer what is happening inside the mind
	- Try and figure out what is happening, tight experiments
- Neuroscience
	- Brain activity

Instrumental/Operational conditioning
- If something is desirable, the relationship is strengthened 

Behaviorism
- Psychology as science of behavior

Problems with behaviorist approach
- Can’t account for diversity of human behavior
	- Language, navigation
- Perhaps limitation to observable isn’t necessarily scientific
	- Electrons, Genes
- Behaviorism was complete flop for applied issues during WWII
	- Staring at radar, false alarms

What is cognitive psychology?
- The scientific study of mental processes
- Includes: 
	- Perception, attention, memory, language, reasoning, problem solving, division making
- Underlying assumption
	- Cognition is like a computer program
	- Cognitive psychologists need to figure out the program
	- Intelligent behavior is decomposable into parts
	- Each part easier to understand than the whole
	- Figure out each little component then build it back up to understand
	- All elements fit together

Information processing stages
- Stimulus -> processing -> more processing -> response
- Each stage
	- Receives information from the previous stage, transfers it, and send info to the next stage

Stages of memory
- Encoding -> storage -> Retrieval
- Studying for an exam to remember things
- Retrieve information on exam day

Two questions
- What are the stages in a task?
- How long does each stage last?

Subtraction method
- Simple RT
	- Detection -> response -> simple RT
- Choice RT
	- Detection -> discrim -> selection -> response -> choice RT
- go/no go RT
	- Detection -> discrim -> response -> go/no go 
- 120 ms about to produce a response

Hick’s law
- Number of choices increase, reaction time increases

Contribution
- Idea that you can measure mental processes
- Similar assumptions in moders research
- Neuroimaging methods frequently use subtraction method

Summary
- Cognitive psych is study of mental processes
- Need to figure out the different cognitive processes ( perception, attention, memory)
- Design experiments to understand various cognitive components
- Using different measures (accuracy, reaction time) to infer mental processes

## Perception basics and pattern recognition

Sensory and perception
- Sensation - stimulation of sense organs
- Perception - selection, organization and interpretation of sensory input
- Psychophysics = the study of how physical stimuli are translated into psych experience

Basic principles
- Three principles emerge with regard to sensation and perception
	- Not one one correspondence between physical and psych reality
	- Sensation and perception are active processes
	- Sens. and perc. are adaptive

Perception
- Dismal - what is actually out there
- Proximal - sensory info impinging on sensory receptors
- Have info about proximal stimulus, not dismal
- Percep. is the construction of model of the world

Perception as induction
- Perception makes inferences to simplify interpretation of sens info
- With partial or missing sens info, percep must fill in gaps to infer
	- (Can't see the back of the cell phone)

Pattern recognition
- Translating patterns of sensory signals into recognizing objects
- Matches memory sensory info

Template matching
- Objects are matches to a template stored in memory
- First proposed by Gestalt Psychologists
- If sensory pattern watches template, object is recognized

Feature analytic approach
- Break stimuli into smaller components
- Recognition based on detection of distinctive features
- Objects are defined by their unique set of features
- Reduces infinite variation in environment to finite categories
- Despite variations of capital A's, they consist of same features

Psych basics for feature theory
- Early 1960s Hubel and Wiesel
	- Micro electrode recordings of axons in primary visual cortex of animals
	- Discovered feature detectors: neurons that responds selectively to lines, edges, etc

Cell types
- Simple cells
	- Receptive field responds to linear stimuli at a particular orientation
- Complex cells
	- Receptive field responds optimally to stimuli at a particular orientation and move in particular direction
- Hypercomplex cells
	- Receptive fields optimally responsive to movement, orientation and length
	- Still more selective than receptive cells 
	- Extending a line outside its receptive field will frequently reduce firing
	- "end stopped cells

Feature analysis in audition
 - Understanding of spoken language is notable example of feature analysis in perception
 - Consonants have definable features
	 - Place of articulation
	 - Voice onset time, when vocal chords start to vibrate

Context in vision
- Word superiority effect
- Better at recognizing letters in words than letters alone, or letters in non words
- Why?
- Both bottom up and top down processes work together in perceiving the letters in a word

Context in Audition
- Problem of invariance
	- No one to one correspondence between acoustic cues and the perceptual events that people perceive
- Pollack and Pickett (1964)
	- Recorded people in conversation, spliced out sections
	- Subjects listening only recognized 54% of the words
	- Subjects recognize near 100% with context

Context in audition (speech)
- Warren (1970)
	- State governors met with their respective legi*latures in the capital city
	- Subjects didn't notice deleted sound

# Thursday 10/6 Week 2
Attention 
- Mental process of concentrating effort on an external or internal event
- Need to efficiently allocate limited cognitive resources toward processing of important info

Metaphors of attention 
- Filter (selective)
- Resource pools (divided)
- Spotlight/zoom lens (spatial)

Cocktail party
- Many conversations all at once
- Can only pay attention to one conversation
- How do you select just one conversation?

Cherry (1953)
- Dichotic listening
	- Stereo headphones
	- Different message to each ear
- Shadowing
	- Repeat speech presented in one of two ears
- How much of the unattended channel do subjects process?
- What noticed about unattended channel?
	- Did notice
		- Change of gender, change to tone, pitch or loudness
	- Didn't notice
		- Change of language

Moray(1959)
- Subjects shadowed one channel
- Unattended channel were word lists repeated up to 35 times in experimental session
- In unattended channel presented
	- "You may stop now" heard by 6%
	- "Name you may stop now" heard by 33%
	- If subjects told to look out for message, heard by 80%

Filtering model - Broadbent (1958)
- Only physical characteristics of channels are extracted and selection based just on phys. chars
- Perceptual analysis largely unlimited in capacity, access to semantics is sharply limited

Attenuation model triesman (1960)
- Some stuff still gets in but it's weaker
- Some things in memory (our name) are already activated a little, even weak singnal can cause us to notice it

What do we know abt capacity limits?
- Open door with right hand
- Can't scratch nose at exact same time
- Selection is make

Processing load and the locus of selection
- High demands of attended stimuli - evidence looks like early selection
- Low demands for attended stimuli - evidence looks like late selection

Attention as resource pools
- In 70s became popular to conceptualize attention as limited pool of resources, can be allocated as needed
- Capacity of attention is amount of resources wanted to allocate
- Divided attention
	- Two things at once

Dual task studies
- Examine capacity limits via dual task studies
- Perform 2 tasks at the same time and manipulate amount of attention allocated to each task
	- Primary and secondairy
- Examine performance tradeoff

Cell phones and driving
- 4x more likely for accident
- More likely to miss red lights
- Effects increase under difficult driving conditions

Single or multiple resource pools
- Initial resource theories suggested that was a single undifferentiated pool if attentional resources
- Sometimes two tasks didn't interfere with each other, even though theoretically they should have
- Suggested that there are multiple pools of resources with each having specific functions

Metaphor for visual attention
- Spotlight of attention
- Flashlight at night ex

Overt and covert orienting
- Overt orienting of attention
	- Fovea is most sensitive region of retina
	- Eyes move to place spatial locations on fovea
	- Look at things we're attending to
- Covert orienting
	- Eye movements are correlated with attention but can be separated

Attention and cueing effects
- Because eyes remain on center fixation, cueing effects reflect movement of visual attention separate from eye movements
- Eye movements and attention are separable
- Are they independent? Correlated?

Rubber band model of attention
- Attention moves to interesting location outside fovea
- Roughly 100 - 200 ms later the eyes move to that location
- 100 - 200 ms later, attention changes

Attention and eye movements
- Can move attention without moving eyes 
- Cant move eyes without moving attention (right before moving eyes)

Inhibition of return
- Attention is slower to return to a previously attended but now unattended location
- Looking for friend in a crowd, looking at new location
- Bias casual system to attend to novel locations instead of previous locations

Objects or locations?
- Attention is inhibited to return to a previously attended but not unattended location
- If object moves, does inhibition travel with the object? Or stay?
- Inhibition of return
	- Attention is with objects not locations
	- Result is to bias out visual system
	- Wants to look for new things
