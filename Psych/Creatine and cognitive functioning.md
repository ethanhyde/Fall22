### Intro
- Effects of creatine in younger and healthy population have mixed results
- Exercise benefitc cognitive process in both young and older adults
- Popular supplement for athletes
	- Helps with recovery, heat tolerance
- Brain now has increased energy demands and muscles
- Goes where it is needed the most
- Reserve energe resource
- Natural creatine increases cognitive functioning when exercising
- Past studies found that creatine helps mood when someone is sleep deprived
	- Caffine, short term solution similar 
- Creatine supps have mixed results on if it helps w executive functioning and working mem tasks
-  Benefits STM tasks and reasoning, but things regarding exec functioning is conflic
- Vegetarian diet
	- Creatine seems to have greater effect on young vegeterians
	- Creatine found in most meat and fish, lower for vegeterians
- This experiment looks into working mem, attention, mind wantering and processing speed
- Hypothesised that creatine supplementation would result in lower levels of negative affect, state anxiety, and perceived stress but would not impact levels of trait anxiety

### Methods
- 49 participants at Nova Southeastern University
	- Partial course credit
- Tested to make sure they weren't using additional creatine
- Either assigned creatine supp of control
- 3 sessions for study measures
	- Between 1 and 2, 5mg of creatine per day and control didn't have any. 50/50 split
- Between Trial 2 and 3, covid inturruption, less signifigant evidence
- Only looking at trial 1 and 2
- Semantic sustained attention to response task
	- Stimuli presented on screen for 300ms, then a mark for 1500ms
	- Frequent to frequent non target stimuli 4
	- 675 trials for 600 non target trials (40 unique animal names)
	- Demonstrates being able to control focus and attention
- Thought probes
	- Participants asked "What were you just thinking about?"
	- Probes occured after 30 trials
	- Measures mind wandering and gives indication of focus
- Symmetry span task
	- Requires participants to remember something whil ebeing engaged in a distractor processing task
	- Asked to confirm symmetry of a photo
	- Participants asked to recall squares in the otder they were presented in
- Pattern compasison task
	- Measures processing speed
	-
