Slave musicians
- Would think slave musician feels good seeing their master listen to their music
	- Sign of hope
- More African sounding swinging music
- Congo dance
	- White dancers listening to black music
	- "AFricanized as they did so, while the black elements became part of the white culture, all unacknowledge or else safely distanced by the minstreling process (193)"
- Unsure of how many slave musicians were actually able to read music
- Many printed dance music sheets
- Unsure of how this skill of reading dance music was learned, mystery
- Slavemasters would have servants who they believed had talent would hire out them for enterainment
-   
It is clear that a complex process of  
interaction was going on, with the white dances and their  
music passing into the slavesâ€™ culture and becoming Africanized  
as they did so, while the black elements became part of the  
white culture, all unacknowledged or else safely distanced by  
the minstrelizing process.

The appearance of blues musicians
- Important for record comanies
	- Result of their policies
- Musicians didn't record their whole catelog of songs, only songs that were selected by the record company
- "When Brwornie McGhee asked to record some of the hillbilly songs he regularly performed, he was told that it was not "his kind of music""(197)
- Record companies wanted blues music, so they went to blues musicians
- Hillibily to hillbilly musicians
- Blues is a feeling and was a common one for newly located black Americans after the Emancipation

Blues with european origins
- Contradiction to previous readings
- The harmonic schemes of blues music comes from European origins
- People who are trained to listen to European music are able to pick up on the suble common themes that were in blues songs and in European music
- "Any attempt to discover a historical connection between Zinbabwe and modern black America would seem merley foolish" (201)
- Blues is much more simple than classical european music
- AAB pattern which repeats itself throughout the song
- Relies heavily on improvitory music skills
- Most have no formal training, but this is the charm of the music
	- Allows for the listener to have a slighly deeper connection with who the musician really is
	- Classical European music is well composed, but lacks the familiarity of a blues song
- Good at strumming the guitar but not at understanding why a chord works

Blues as a vocal art (204)
- The voice of a human is huge for blues songs
- Transferes that sound to the instruments
- Usually one vocalist
	- Accompanied by single instrument or small band
- Different than classical music vibrato singing
- Similar to gospel singer
- "Blues is primarily a vocal art; the human voice is always paramount and the paradigm of blues sound is vocal, even when it is transferred to instruments (204)"
