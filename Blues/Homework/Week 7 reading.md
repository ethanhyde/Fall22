Difference between folk and pop music
- Important to understand what modern blues is exactly accomplishing
- Van Vechen, Hammon, and Lomax wanted to give people the feeling that they were feeling from the music that they were creating
- Different than just single use, everyday entertainment
- deeper meaning and connections to experiences that other people can relate to
- Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby were in the spotlight, but the magic was in the blues music
- These musicians wanted to make the world aware of that
- The author states "Modern fans like myself, when we fantasize about going back to the 1930s and seeing the Count Basie band in its prime, dream of being transported ot Harlem's Savoy Ballroom surrounded by a hot, swinging crowd of dancers" (235).
- The environment is what draws people in to these concerts
- Can't quite be replicated in a living room or in the future
