###### -   What were some direct causes of the development of urban blues, according to Jones? 
-   What are some differences between Southern and Northern identity as noted by Jones? How did these identities affect one another?
-   What do you think Jones means when he writes “the North suddenly represented a _further_ idea of what this country and what a black man’s life might be" (96)?
-   Jones writes that “not only were the race records sold in great numbers but Americans began to realize for the first time that there was a _native_ American music as traditionally wild, happy, disenchanted, and unfettered as it had become fashionable for them to this they themselves had become” (100). What, do you think Jones would say, is _native_ about blues? Carrying the metaphor forward to the present day, what styles of music would you like to argue are consistent with Americans’ contemporary ideas about their identity?
-   How did increased consumption of blues records affect blues music, according to Jones? (103)

Turn of the century
- "Psychological realignment" second page top
	- Reassess worth of black man within a society
Differences between big city and rural blues
- "Classic blues was entertainment and country blues, folklore" (105)
- New city jazz was lot different
	- Cruel, hopeless, grim and life in the big city was raw
- More formal music, less relaxed
- Urban life was really different and strange
- Used music to cope, like they had in the past
- just as strange as their ansestors made to the new world many years before
- People didn't make them feel like they belonged
	- "Hey cornbread" (106)

Going to the North
- Moving North was a chance for more opportunities
- Life in South didn't have as many options as North did at the time
- This move made jazz and classic blues come to be
- Might not have happened without it
- “the North suddenly represented a _further_ idea of what this country and what a black man’s life might be" (96)
	- Even more than they thought they would get out of it
	- Many reasons for leaving the South, and different for each person
	- Place for a new life, new beginning
	- Become human again
	- Part of society
	- Spreading out through the Country: Chicago, Detroit, NY, LA, very large black populations
