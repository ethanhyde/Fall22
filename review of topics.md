		- Boxes with arrows and different speeds, check slideshow

Perception
- Distil stimuli (realworld)
- top down or bottom up processes, check end of slideshow from today

Gestali Principles
- Proximity
- Similarity
	- Close together similar things
- Good continuation
- Closure

Feature analytic approach
- Visual coretex breaks stimuli into feature
	- Lines by orientation
	- And even lines by motion

Feature analyses in audition
- Understanding of spoken language is noticable example of feature analysis in perception
- Consonants have definable features
	- Place of articulation: were air is stopped

Inhibition of return
- Slower to return to a location with eye tracking
- Slower to go to objects than to location

- Posner and snyder
	- Automatic and controlled processing

Feature and conjunction search
- Feature search
	- Automatic, fast pop out
- Conjunction search
	- More controlled
	- Slower
	- Depends on number of distractors
